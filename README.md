Transportation ETA

A Python-based supply chain transportation service that predicts delays, optimizes routes, and provides interactive visualizations using machine learning.

##Features

Delay Prediction: Uses machine learning to predict delays for supply chain routes based on distance, weather, and traffic factors.
Route Optimization: Suggests optimized routes to reduce delays and improve supply chain efficiency.
Interactive Visualizations: Generates HTML maps to visualize routes dynamically.

##Installation

####Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transportation-eta.git
cd transportation-eta

####Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

	python3 -m venv env
	source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

####Install dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage

The tool provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing routes, predicting delays, and visualizing routes.

1. Add a New Route - Add a route to the system with its start location, end location, and distance.
	
 python main.py add_route --route_id R1 --start Chicago --end Detroit --distance 450

2. Predict Delays - Predict delays for a specific route using optional weather and traffic factors.

python main.py predict --route_id R1 --weather 1.2 --traffic 1.1

3. Visualize a Route - Generate an interactive HTML map for a specific route.

python main.py visualize --route_id R1

##Running Tests - Run the unit tests with coverage reporting:

pytest tests/test_agent.py --cov=agent --cov-report=term-missing
